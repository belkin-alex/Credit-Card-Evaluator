# Credit-Card-Evaluator
Simple utility to calculate total cashback based on my PNC credit card spending. I constructed this to evaluate performance between several credit cards that I was considering. The script works by the user inputting desired cashback percentages per category to test, assigns the percentage and calculates cashback for each row in the sample .csv data, then generates the sum.

For my own personal use, I tested the PNC Cash Rewards card, Chase Freedom Unlimited, and Citi Custom Cash card. Based on my existing spending data, the Chase card yielded the most cashback.
